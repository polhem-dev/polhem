## Initialization Order Constraints

The framework registers itself in the standard `IServiceCollection` DI container; framework services are resolved through ctor injection rather than static entry points. Host startup must run the following steps in order:

1. `var paths = new PathOptions { DefinePath = "..." }` — locate definition files
2. `var settings = SystemSettingsLoader.Load(paths)` — read `SystemSettings.xml` (boot-time only; runtime cached access goes through DI-resolved `IDefineAccess`)
3. `SysInfo.Initialize(settings.CommonConfiguration)` — process-wide debug flag and allowed type namespaces (a host that serves the API also runs `ApiServiceOptions.Initialize(settings.CommonConfiguration.ApiPayloadOptions, settings.CommonConfiguration.IsDebugMode)` for the payload compressor and encryptor; a remote client adopts the server's options in `SystemApiConnector.InitializeAsync`)
4. `services.AddPolhemFramework(settings.BackendConfiguration, paths)` — register framework services (extension from `Polhem.Hosting`)
5. Build the service provider, then:
   - **ASP.NET Core hosts** call `services.AddJsonRpcServer()` and `services.AddPolhemApiKeyGateCheck()` before building, and `app.MapJsonRpc("/api")` on the built application. The gate check runs when the host starts (see [API Key Management](../security/api-key-management.md)).
   - **Non-web hosts** that run the backend in process hand the resulting `IServiceProvider` to the client side: the `Polhem.Api.Client` connectors take it as a constructor argument, and a native UI head assigns it to `ClientInfo.LocalServiceProvider` (`Polhem.UI.Core`).

See [development-cookbook.md § Framework Initialization Order](../guides/development-cookbook.md#framework-initialization-order) for the canonical reference.

### Consequences of Violation

- Resolving framework services before `AddPolhemFramework` → DI container throws `InvalidOperationException` (service not registered)
- Calling `SystemSettingsLoader.Load` on a path with no `SystemSettings.xml` → throws `FileNotFoundException`
- Constructing a `DbAccess` by database id → its constructor requires an `IDbConnectionManager` (a `null` one throws `ArgumentNullException`); obtain those instances through DI-injected `IDbAccessFactory.Create(databaseId)` instead. (Another constructor takes an already-open `DbConnection` plus its `DatabaseType` and needs no connection manager — it is for callers that own the connection, such as code that writes inside an existing transaction.)

### Reference Example

`tests/Polhem.Tests.Shared/TestProcessBootstrap.cs` demonstrates the correct initialization order for the test process.

## Cached Data Immutability After Init

After framework initialization, **every server-side cached object is read-only
and must not be mutated at runtime**. Each session receives the same in-memory
instance out of the process-wide `ICacheContainer`; per-session adjustments leak
to every other session, and concurrent mutations race.

The rule follows from the cache being shared, not from where the data came from.
It therefore covers both kinds of cache below — definition data loaded from the
definition files, and snapshots loaded from the database.

### Scope: Definition-File Caches

Anything reached through `IDefineAccess.GetX(...)` (which is backed by the
`ICacheContainer` slot of the same name):

- `FormSchema`, `FormLayout`, `TableSchema`
- `SystemSettings`, `DatabaseSettings`, `ProgramSettings`, `DbCategorySettings`
- `MenuSettings`, `PluginSettings`, `PermissionModels`, `CurrencySettings`,
  `UnitSettings`
- `LanguageResource`

### Scope: Database-Backed Caches

These are loaded through `ICacheDataSourceProvider` rather than `IDefineAccess`,
and invalidated through the common cache-notify table rather than by a `SaveX`
call — but they live in the same process-wide `ICacheContainer` and are shared by
every session in exactly the same way, so the same prohibition applies. Reach
them through the `ICacheContainer` slot or the service that wraps it
(`ICompanyInfoService`, `IRolePermissionService`, `IDepartmentTreeService`,
`IAuditRuleService`, `IApiKeyValidator`):

| Cached type | `ICacheContainer` slot | Cache key |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| `CompanyInfo` | `CompanyInfo` | company id |
| `CompanyRolePermissions` | `CompanyRolePermissions` | company id |
| `DepartmentTree` | `DepartmentTree` | company id |
| `CompanyAuditRules` | `CompanyAuditRules` | company id |
| `ApiKeyInfo` | `ApiKey` | key `sys_id` |
| `ApiKeyGateState` | `ApiKeyGate` | `ApiKeyGateState.CacheKey` |

`CompanyAuditRules` and `CompanyRolePermissions` enforce the rule structurally —
they expose no setters and build their indexes once in the constructor. The other
four use init-only properties, so their values cannot be reassigned after
construction, but the collections some of them hold (`CompanyInfo.NumberFormats`,
`DepartmentTree.Roots` and its nodes' children) are ordinary mutable collections.
On those the rule is a convention the compiler cannot check; treat an instance
handed to you by the cache as frozen.

### Scope: The Exceptions

- `SessionInfo` is a deliberate exception — it is a per-session entity, not
  shared data, and the cache key is the access token.
- `DatabaseSettings` is changed in place by the framework itself:
  `IDefineAccess.GetDatabaseSettings()` decrypts the `enc:` passwords of the
  cached instance on read. This is safe only because the decryption is
  idempotent and each field is written with one reference assignment (the
  reasoning is on `CacheDefineAccess.GetDatabaseSettings`). It is not a pattern
  to copy. `SaveDatabaseSettings` encrypts a clone, so the instance you pass to
  it is not turned into ciphertext.

### Forbidden Patterns

| Pattern | Why bad |
|---------|---------|
| `cachedSchema.DisplayName = "..."` | Mutates shared instance → cross-session leak / race |
| Storing per-session state in `Tag` / extension properties on a cached object | `Tag` is also process-shared |
| Adding, removing or replacing children in a collection of a cached instance (`schema.Tables`, `schema.MasterTable.Fields`, …) | Same race surface |

### Correct Approach

- **Need a per-session view (e.g. localized schema)?** Clone first, mutate the clone:
  ```csharp
  // `languageService` is the injected ILanguageService.
  var customised = cachedSchema.Clone();
  new FormSchemaLocalizer(languageService).Localize(customised, sessionLang);
  return customised;
  ```
- **Persistent changes to definition data** go through `IDefineAccess.SaveX(...)`
  which:
  1. Writes to backing storage
  2. Invalidates the cache slot so the next `GetX` rebuilds from storage
- **Persistent changes to database-backed data** go through the owning repository
  plus a cache-notify entry; the poller then invalidates the slot in every
  process. There is no `SaveX` for these, and writing the row without the notify
  entry leaves every process serving the stale snapshot.
- **Need a deep copy?** Use the type's `Clone()` method where it has one
  (`FormSchema`, `FormTable`, `FormField`, `FormLayout`, `TableSchema`,
  `DatabaseSettings` and their child items). The other definition types
  (`SystemSettings`, `ProgramSettings`, `DbCategorySettings`, `MenuSettings`,
  `PluginSettings`, `PermissionModels`, `CurrencySettings`, `UnitSettings`,
  `LanguageResource`) have none; an `XmlCodec` serialize/deserialize
  round trip gives an independent copy of what the XML carries. Serializing
  reads the source without changing it, which is also how the framework
  answers definition reads over the API.
  **The database-backed types have no `Clone()`** — they are snapshots meant to
  be read, not customized. If you need a per-session variant, copy the values you
  need into your own object rather than adding a `Clone()` and mutating.

### Why This Matters

Polhem is designed for multi-tenant ASP.NET Core / Blazor Server hosts where a
single process serves many concurrent sessions, each potentially in a different
language and tenant context. The cache is a singleton, and nothing locks a
cached instance while one request reads it and another writes it. The invariant
**"cached data is immutable after load"** is the single rule that lets every
session safely share the same cached instances without coordination.

The database-backed caches raise the stakes rather than lowering them: they hold
authorization state. A mutated `CompanyRolePermissions` or `DepartmentTree` does
not merely show one session the wrong caption — it grants or denies access in
other sessions.

## Cross-Layer Forbidden Practices

| Forbidden | Reason | Correct Approach |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| API layer directly references the Repository layer (`Polhem.Api.Core`; **not** the composition root `Polhem.Hosting`, whose job is to wire every layer) | Violates layered architecture | Access indirectly through a Business Object |
| Business Object directly creates a `DbConnection` | Bypasses connection management and logging | Put the query in a repository (next row); the repository uses `DbAccess` |
| BO references `Polhem.Db` (`Polhem.Business.csproj` has no `ProjectReference` to `Polhem.Db`) | BO is a thin shell over business logic; data access belongs to Repository | FormSchema-driven CRUD → `IDataFormRepository`; custom queries → ad-hoc bo repo with `IDbAccessFactory` |
| BO hard-codes a `databaseId` string or reads `SessionInfo.CompanyId` / `CompanyInfo` directly | Couples BO to the routing implementation; breaks when deployments change | Use `BusinessObject.ResolveDatabaseId(DbScope)` (custom bo repo) or `CreateDataFormRepository(progId)` (FormSchema CRUD); the helpers delegate to `IRepositoryDatabaseRouter` which is the single source of truth |
| Client side resolves Repository services from a DI container | Server-only | Call the API via `ApiConnector` |
| Skipping the Payload Pipeline order | Breaks encryption / decryption consistency | Maintain Serialize → Compress → Encrypt |
| BO returns API types directly | BO must not depend on API serialization formats | Return BO types; `ApiOutputConverter` maps them automatically by naming convention |

## ExecFunc Development Constraints

### Method Signature Rules

ExecFunc handler methods must follow these rules:

- **Must** be `public` methods (reflection invocation requires it)
- **Must** be non-generic (`GetMethod()` does not support generic resolution)
- **Fixed signature**: `void MethodName(ExecFuncArgs args, ExecFuncResult result)`
- **FuncId maps to method name**, case-sensitive
- **Must** declare `[ExecFuncAccessControl]`. Dispatch is fail-closed: a method without it is refused with `UnauthorizedAccessException` and cannot be called at all (`ExecFuncHandlerExtensions.InvokeExecFunc`). Analyzer rule POLHEM3003 reports the omission as a build warning, so it shows up before a client's first call.

### Access Control Declaration

```csharp
// Anonymous access
[ExecFuncAccessControl(ApiAccessRequirement.Anonymous)]
public void PublicMethod(ExecFuncArgs args, ExecFuncResult result) { }

// Login required (the constructor's default; [ExecFuncAccessControl] alone means the same)
[ExecFuncAccessControl(ApiAccessRequirement.Authenticated)]
public void SecureMethod(ExecFuncArgs args, ExecFuncResult result) { }

// Refused for remote callers; only an in-process call may run it
[ExecFuncAccessControl(ApiAccessRequirement.Authenticated, LocalOnly = true)]
public void MaintenanceMethod(ExecFuncArgs args, ExecFuncResult result) { }
```

## Exception Handling Rules

### Client-Visible Exception Types

The server maps an exception to a JSON-RPC error code (`PolhemExceptionMapper`) through [`JsonRpcErrorContract`](../../../src/Polhem.Api.Core/JsonRpc/JsonRpcErrorContract.cs), the single declaration both ends read. See [ADR-043](../../../maintainers/adr/adr-043-error-contract-single-registry.md) for the reasoning. What reaches the caller falls into three groups:

- **The framework's own exceptions carry their message to the caller.** `UserMessageException` (**preferred** for anything an end user should read) and `JsonRpcException` travel as `JsonRpcErrorCode.UserMessage` (`-32099`); `AuthenticationRequiredException`, `CompanyNotEnteredException`, `CompanyAccessDeniedException`, `ForbiddenException` and `ReplayRejectedException` each travel under a code of their own. Client-side error handling that assumes every user-facing failure arrives as `-32099` will misclassify these.
- **BCL exceptions keep a code but not their message.** `UnauthorizedAccessException`, `ArgumentException`, `InvalidOperationException`, `NotSupportedException` and `FormatException` (each with its subclasses) travel as `-32099` with a fixed, generic message such as "The request is not valid."; the real message is logged on the server (by `PolhemExceptionMapper`). These types are what the BCL, database drivers and infrastructure throw with table names, parameter names and server details in the text, so none of it is shown to a remote caller.
- **Everything else** is masked as `"Internal server error"` under `JsonRpcErrorCode.InternalError` (`-32000`), and the real message is logged.

When debug mode is on (`SysInfo.IsDebugMode`, set from `CommonConfiguration.IsDebugMode`), the original message is passed through instead of the fixed or masked one; the codes stay the same. The stack trace is never included, in either mode.

### When to Use Each Type

| Exception type | Usage |
|----------------|-------|
| `UserMessageException` | **Preferred**: any message intended to be shown to the end user (business-rule violation, validation failure, workflow interruption). |
| `ForbiddenException` | The caller lacks a permission (`-32004`). The framework throws it from the permission gates. |
| `ArgumentException`, `InvalidOperationException`, `NotSupportedException`, `FormatException` | Their BCL meaning: a caller passed a bad argument, an object is in the wrong state, a feature does not apply, text cannot be parsed. A remote caller sees only the fixed message, so do not use them to tell the user something. |
| `UnauthorizedAccessException` | Access refused on the server. A remote caller sees only the fixed message "Access denied."; throw `AuthenticationRequiredException` when the caller has to sign in again. |
| `JsonRpcException` | Protocol-level errors of the API framework itself (HTTP status / JSON-RPC error code). |

### Translatable Messages

`UserMessageException` and the framework's other user-facing exceptions implement `ILocalizableMessage`: besides the English text in `Message` they can carry a language key and the message arguments.

```csharp
throw new UserMessageException("MyApp.Order.CreditLimit", "Order {0} exceeds the credit limit.", orderNo);
```

The key is a full language key, `{namespace}.{subKey}`, split at the first dot; the translation lives under that namespace in the deployment's language resources. Before the response leaves the server, the executor looks the key up through `ILanguageService` in the session's culture, following the language fall-back chain, and formats the translation with the arguments. When no culture translates the key, or the translation names a placeholder the arguments cannot fill, the English text is sent. `Message` stays English on the server, so logs keep reading it. The framework's own messages use keys under `PolhemMessages`; a form rule's message uses `{ProgId}.Rule.{RuleId}.Message`.

### Client-Side Behaviour

`ApiConnector.FinalizeResponse` rebuilds exceptions based on `JsonRpcError.Code`:

- A code that declares an exception type → rebuilt as that type, carrying the message verbatim (no prefix), so the caller can branch on the type. `-32099` is always rebuilt as `UserMessageException`, whichever type was thrown on the server; `-32001` is rebuilt as `AuthenticationRequiredException`, which derives from `UnauthorizedAccessException`.
- Every other code → `InvalidOperationException($"API error: {code} - {message}")`, preserving the protocol-level debugging info

Recommended client-side catch order:

```csharp
try
{
    var response = await connector.SaveAsync(dataSet);
}
catch (UserMessageException ex)
{
    // -32099: a business message, or the fixed text of a masked BCL failure
    ShowMessage(ex.Message);
}
catch (ForbiddenException ex)
{
    // -32004: the user lacks the permission
    ShowMessage(ex.Message);
}
catch (AuthenticationRequiredException)
{
    // -32001: missing, invalid or expired access token
    ReturnToSignIn();
}
catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
{
    // Any other code: "API error: {code} - {message}"
    LogError(ex);
}
```

### Extension Paths

- Need to classify errors (e.g. a "not found" case the client treats differently): subclass `UserMessageException`, which is not sealed. The subclass travels as `-32099` with its message, and the client rebuilds it as `UserMessageException`, so branch on the message key or text rather than the subclass on the client.
- `JsonRpcError.Data` carries no structured payload today: the executor leaves it empty, and the ASP.NET Core transport puts the real message of a failure that escapes the executor there only when the host runs in the Development environment.

### Design Intent

- Prevent leakage of internal implementation details to the client
- Provide an independent channel for business messages, type-separated from "real program errors", to ease logging / monitoring routing

## FormSchema Design Constraints

- The cached FormSchema is **read-only** at runtime (see [Cached Data Immutability After Init](#cached-data-immutability-after-init)); fields are not added dynamically
- `IFormCommandBuilder` (in `Polhem.Db.Dml`) is the contract for CRUD command construction; each DB provider implements it (`SqlFormCommandBuilder` / `PgFormCommandBuilder` / `MySqlFormCommandBuilder` / `OracleFormCommandBuilder` / `SqliteFormCommandBuilder`), with no common base class
- `TableSchemaGenerator` and `FormLayoutGenerator` produce a TableSchema and a FormLayout from a FormSchema; they do not merge with an existing file. Precision, indexes or default values you adjusted by hand in a TableSchema are lost if you regenerate it, so after the first generation edit the TableSchema itself
- `FormTable.DbTableName`: optional field; when empty, the command builders use `FormTable.TableName` as the physical table name. A form that other forms reference through `RelationProgId` should set it on its master table: the lookup JOIN reads the related master table's `DbTableName` without that fallback. Naming should follow the [Database Naming Conventions](../database/database-naming-conventions.md) (lowercase + snake_case)

## Type Safety Constraints

### Wire Type Whitelist

Most wire members have a declared type, and a registered formatter reads them (next section). Encoded and Encrypted request bodies are decoded into the parameter type of the action the method name resolves to; the type name a client sends alongside is only checked for consistency.

A value in an `object`-typed member — a filter value, a `ParameterCollection` entry, a cell of an untyped column — names its own type on the wire instead, on both the MessagePack and the JSON codec. That name is screened against a whitelist before the type is resolved, and the writing end applies the same check, so a value the reader would refuse fails where it is written rather than in the other process. The whitelist (`src/Polhem.Api.Core/MessagePack/WireTypeWhitelist.cs`) admits:

- The fixed BCL set: `Boolean`, `Byte`, `SByte`, `Int16`, `UInt16`, `Int32`, `UInt32`, `Int64`, `UInt64`, `Single`, `Double`, `Decimal`, `String`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `TimeSpan`, `DateOnly`, `Guid`, `Byte[]`, `DBNull`, `System.Data.DataTable`, `Object` and `Object[]` (the `System.` prefix is omitted here)
- Single-dimensional arrays of an allowed element type, such as `int[]`, `string[]` or `Guid[]`; multi-dimensional arrays are refused
- Types in the namespaces of `SysInfo.AllowedTypeNamespaces`: the framework's own (`Polhem.Core`, `Polhem.Definition`, `Polhem.Api.Contracts`, `Polhem.Api.Core`, `Polhem.Business`) plus the `|`-separated list in `CommonConfiguration.AllowedTypeNamespaces`. The generic arguments of a generic type are screened too
- The assembly part of the name must be one of the runtime assemblies behind the fixed set, or an assembly whose name is an allowed namespace or starts with one. A deployment whose own types live in an assembly named outside its allowed namespaces has to add that name as well

Enums and `ParameterCollection` values work on every platform. A value of any other type from an allowed namespace needs dynamic code to serialize over MessagePack, so where dynamic code is unavailable (iOS, Mac Catalyst) it fails with a `NotSupportedException` that names the type.

### Wire Types Must Register a Formatter

Every type that travels on the MessagePack wire is registered explicitly — the contractless
resolver is a desktop-only convenience, not the carrying mechanism, because .NET for iOS turns
dynamic code off and an unregistered type fails there outright. Adding a message contract, a
definition type reachable from one, or a new closed generic instantiation (`List<T>`,
`Dictionary<K,V>`, `T?`, an enum) means adding a registration. The drift tests walk the same type
closure, and `WireContractDriftTests` fails when one is missing (a failing test, not a failing build). See
[ADR-037](../../../maintainers/adr/adr-037-wire-explicit-registration.md).

### API Contract Naming Convention (Mandatory)

API Request / Response and BO Args / Result types must follow naming conventions so that `ApiOutputConverter` can automatically map BO return values to API types (see [ADR-007](../../../maintainers/adr/adr-007-convention-based-type-resolution.md)):

| Layer | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| BO (`Polhem.Business`) | `{Action}Args` | `{Action}Result` |
| API (`Polhem.Api.Core`) | `{Action}Request` | `{Action}Response` |
| Contract (`Polhem.Api.Contracts`) | `I{Action}Request` | `I{Action}Response` |

- Types deviating from the naming convention will not be auto-converted; BO return values will pass through to the client and cause type errors
- Response mapping needs **no manual registration**: it is resolved by the naming convention above. The registry that once required `Register` calls is gone, and so is the Typeless serialization it whitelisted for — see [ADR-007](../../../maintainers/adr/adr-007-convention-based-type-resolution.md) and [ADR-037](../../../maintainers/adr/adr-037-wire-explicit-registration.md)

## Account Security Constraints

- `LoginAttemptTracker` default policy: 5 failed sign-ins within 15 minutes lock the account for 15 minutes (`DefaultMaxFailedAttempts`, `DefaultLockoutMinutes`)
- During lockout, `SystemBusinessObject.Login` rejects the attempt before checking the password
- Successful login resets the failure counter
- The counts are kept per process: with several nodes, each node keeps its own

## Session Persistence Constraints

Signing in writes a rebuild seed to `st_session`, and `SessionInfoCache` rebuilds an evicted session
from it. Three constraints follow:

- **The seed is not a snapshot.** It holds only what cannot be derived again — user, expiry,
  company. The row is found by a SHA-256 hash of the access token; the token itself is not stored.
  Roles, customization code and record-scope row ids are recomputed on every rebuild.
  Do not add derivable state to `SessionUser`: a value stored there stops tracking its source, and
  a permission revoked after sign-in would survive in the copy.
- **Session rebuild requires a key provider that can recover the session key.**
  `DerivedApiEncryptionKeyProvider` (the default) and `StaticApiEncryptionKeyProvider` can;
  `DynamicApiEncryptionKeyProvider` cannot, because its key exists only inside the session. Under
  the dynamic provider, sessions are deliberately not rebuilt at all — an evicted session sends the
  user back to sign-in rather than into a session that looks valid but fails every encrypted call.
- **A custom sign-in flow must go through the framework's construction path.** Code that builds a
  `SessionInfo` and only calls `SessionInfoService.Set` produces a session with no row behind it:
  it dies at the next restart, and on another node it does not exist at all.

## API Replay Protection Constraints

With `ApiServiceOptions.RequireWireFrame` enabled (it is off by default), Encoded and Encrypted
requests carry a wire frame (timestamp + sequence number) inside the payload. The server refuses a
frame whose timestamp is further from server time than `ApiServiceOptions.WireFrameTimestampTolerance`
(five minutes by default), and, for a method whose `[ApiAccessControl]` declares
`ReplayProtection = ApiReplayProtection.UniqueSequence`, a sequence number the session has already
used. Both refusals are `ReplayRejectedException` (`-32005`). See
[ADR-042](../../../maintainers/adr/adr-042-api-replay-protection.md) for the reasoning. These constraints follow:

- **Both ends must be set to the same value.** Whether a frame is present is a deployment-level
  fact and is never read from the packet — were the server to "detect" it, an attacker could turn
  the protection off simply by removing the frame. A mismatched pair therefore fails, deliberately.
  Rollout order: **upgrade the package on both ends first, then enable the switch on both**.
- **`UniqueSequence` needs the switch.** While `RequireWireFrame` is off, nothing is checked; a host
  built with `AddPolhemFramework` logs a startup warning naming the methods that declare
  `UniqueSequence` in that state.
- **The Plain path is unprotected.** Plaintext offers no binding an attacker cannot forge: any
  anti-replay field can be rewritten (to the current time, to a higher sequence), which makes it a
  fresh legitimate request rather than a replay. Methods at `ApiProtectionLevel.Public` — including
  `Save`, `Delete` and `ExecFunc` — may still be called as Plain, and that path carries no frame and
  is not checked. `Encoded` carries a frame but has no HMAC, so a captured Encoded call can be
  re-framed with a fresh sequence number. Only inside an Encrypted payload does the payload HMAC
  cover the frame, so `UniqueSequence` protects Encrypted calls only.
- **The default window is per process.** The accept-or-reject decision is made by
  `ApiServiceOptions.ReplayWindowStore`, an `IReplayWindowStore`. The default,
  `MemoryReplayWindowStore`, keeps it in process memory: with several nodes behind a load balancer
  and no token affinity, a captured request can be replayed once per node. A deployment that cannot
  accept that implements `IReplayWindowStore.TryAcceptAsync` over a shared store (a cache or a
  database), with the check and the record made as one atomic step.
- **A timed-out request fails on resend rather than retrying successfully.** Sequence numbers reject
  replays; idempotency keys make retries safe. Neither substitutes for the other. The framework has
  no automatic retry, but a retry loop in your own code — or a user pressing "submit" again — will
  hit this. Implement an idempotency key where a retry has to be safe.
- **Anonymous calls are not sequence-checked.** Sequence numbers are counted per session, and there
  is no session before sign-in. If `ExecFuncAnonymous` has side effects, its idempotency is the
  application's responsibility.

## Database Schema Constraints

The framework's schema definition (`TableSchema`) and upgrade mechanism (`TableUpgradeOrchestrator`) **deliberately do not support** the following database-level elements:

- **Foreign Key constraints**
- **Triggers**
- **Views**

### Design Principle

Referential integrity, business rules, and derived data are handled by **the application code (Business Object layer)**; the schema definition only describes table structure (columns, indexes, primary keys).

### Rationale

- Database-layer dependencies make cross-provider support and schema upgrades extremely costly
- In real-world ERP scenarios, the BO layer can fully express business rules; pushing them down to the DB is unnecessary
- Upgrade flows (adding / removing columns, changing types) avoid cascading concerns such as FK suspension, trigger rebuilds, or view refreshes

### If You Truly Need FK / Trigger / View

Maintain them with project-specific migration scripts outside the framework. The upgrade pipeline will not produce corresponding DDL and provides no compatibility guarantees.
