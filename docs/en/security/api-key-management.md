# API Key Management

[繁體中文](../../zh-TW/security/api-key-management.md) · [← Docs Index](../README.md)

An API key answers **which application is calling**. It is not user authentication — that stays with
the Bearer access token, and no key grants any data access on its own. The two travel together on
every remote call: `X-Api-Key` says *what* is calling, `Authorization: Bearer` says *who*.

> A key held by a client is not a secret in the cryptographic sense: it ships inside your desktop or
> mobile application and can be recovered from it. Treat it as an application identity that can be
> revoked, not as a password.

## 1. The gate turns itself on

A deployment that has never issued a key keeps the pre-gate behaviour — any non-empty `X-Api-Key`
passes — so upgrading the framework locks nobody out. **Issuing the first enabled key closes the
gate**, after which only issued keys are accepted. There is no setting to flip.

| State | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `st_api_key` absent, or holds no enabled key | Gate not in force: any non-empty header passes. `UsePolhemFramework` reports it at startup — as a warning in the Development environment, as an error everywhere else. |
| At least one enabled key | Gate in force: the header must carry a valid, enabled, unexpired key. |

The default validator exempts one method from the key, `System.Ping`, so a health check still
answers when the key store cannot be read.

Rejections are deliberately merged into one outcome — malformed, unknown, disabled and expired are
indistinguishable to the caller, so the API cannot be used to probe which identifiers exist. The
reasons are separated in the audit record only.

An identifier that is not issued (or whose key is disabled) is remembered as unknown for one minute,
in a bounded set, so a client that keeps retrying with a revoked key does not reach the database on
every call. Each distinct unknown identifier still costs one database read; throttling probe traffic
belongs to a rate limit in front of the API. Issuing or enabling a key clears the marker through the
same cache-notify as any other key change.

## 2. Issuing a key

`SystemBusinessObject.CreateApiKey` generates the secret server-side and returns the complete
plaintext key **once**. Only a salted hash is stored, so the framework cannot show the key again —
losing it means issuing a replacement, which is the rotation procedure anyway.

```csharp
var response = await connector.CreateApiKeyAsync(
    sysId: "acme-portal",              // lowercase letters, digits and hyphens
    sysName: "ACME Customer Portal",
    keyType: ApiKeyType.ThirdParty,
    contact: "ops@acme.example",       // so an incident has someone to reach
    expiredAt: null);                  // or a UTC instant

// The only moment this value exists outside the server:
Console.WriteLine(response.ApiKey);    // "acme-portal.<secret>"
```

The identifier is the leading segment of the key itself and is **not** a secret — it appears in logs
and audit records by design, which is what makes "which application caused this" answerable.

## 3. Who may manage keys

A key belongs to the **installation**, not to any company, so company roles do not govern it. Key
management is gated on the deployment-level axis instead:

- **A remote caller must be a deployment administrator** (`st_user.deployment_admin`). Being merely
  signed in is not enough, and a company administrator gains nothing here.
- **An in-process (local) call passes without one.** That is the bootstrap path: a deployment with
  no administrator yet must still be able to mint its first key on the host.

The rule covers every key management method: `CreateApiKey`, `ListApiKeys`, `SetApiKeyEnabled` and
`SetApiKeyExpiry`. All of them require an Encrypted call, and `CreateApiKey`, `SetApiKeyEnabled` and
`SetApiKeyExpiry` also declare replay protection (`ApiReplayProtection.UniqueSequence`): when the
deployment turns on `ApiServiceOptions.RequireWireFrame`, a replayed copy of such a call is refused.
The limits of that check are in
[Development Constraints § API Replay Protection](../architecture/development-constraints.md#api-replay-protection-constraints).

See [Permission & Authorization, Part 3](permission-authorization.md) for the deployment-level model
and how to appoint the first administrator.

## 4. Rotating a key

Rotation never has a window where the application is locked out, because the old and new keys are
both live in the middle of it.

1. **Issue a replacement.** `sys_id` is unique, so the new key needs its own identifier — the
   convention is a suffix: `acme-portal` → `acme-portal-2`. Both keys are enabled and both work.
2. **Move the clients over.** Update the stored key on each installation (see §6). Traffic shifts
   gradually; nothing breaks while it does.
3. **Confirm the old key is idle.** The login, change, access and API-anomaly logs record
   `api_key_id`, so a query over them shows whether anything still presents the old identifier.
4. **Disable the old key.** `SetApiKeyEnabled(sysId, false)` revokes it. The change is announced
   through cache-notify in the same transaction as the write, so every server process drops its
   cached copy on its next poll (`CacheNotifyOptions.IntervalSeconds`) instead of honouring the key
   until the cache entry lapses.

Instead of step 4 you can set an expiry (`SetApiKeyExpiry`) to schedule the retirement rather than
performing it. A past instant is accepted there, which retires a key as of now while leaving the
reason visible in the row.

> **On a deployment holding only one key, disabling it re-opens the gate** — with no enabled key
> left, the pre-gate behaviour returns and any non-empty header is accepted again. This is why
> rotation issues the replacement *first*. Never disable your way down to zero.

Keys are never deleted by the framework. A disabled row keeps `api_key_id` in the audit trail
resolvable; deleting it would leave historical log rows pointing at nothing.

## 5. Third-party integrations

Issue a **separate key per third party** and set `KeyType = ApiKeyType.ThirdParty` with a `Contact`.
The type is a label with no authorization meaning, but together with the contact it is what makes an
incident actionable — you can tell whose key is misbehaving and whom to call.

Give third-party keys an expiry. An integration that goes quiet is otherwise indistinguishable from
one that is still live, and a key that outlives the relationship is the one nobody remembers to
revoke.

## 6. Where clients keep their key

Clients read and persist their key through `IApiKeyStorage` (`Polhem.UI.Core`), assigned as
`ClientInfo.ApiKeyStorage`. `ClientInfo.ApplyApiKey(defaultApiKey)` seeds empty storage with the
application's built-in value and otherwise uses what is stored, so changing a key never requires
recompiling a client.

The default is `FileEndpointStorage`, which keeps the key in `apikey.txt` beside the endpoint, in a
folder named after the application under the per-user local application data directory. The file is
written owner-only: on Unix it is created with mode `0600`, and on Windows it inherits the per-user
folder's access list. Browser (WebAssembly) hosts have no persistent file system and replace both
`ClientInfo.EndpointStorage` and `ClientInfo.ApiKeyStorage` with an implementation backed by browser
storage; the framework does not ship one.

## 7. What gets recorded

Rows on the login, change, access and API-anomaly logs carry `api_key_id` and `api_key_name`, so
"which application did this" is answerable without a join.

Key management operations are themselves recorded, on the change axis under the `System` prog id,
marked sensitive, with before/after values — an issued key logs its identifier, name, type, contact
and expiry, and **never the secret or its hash**.
