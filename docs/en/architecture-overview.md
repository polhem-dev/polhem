## 1. Core Architecture Philosophy

Polhem adopts a **Definition-Driven Architecture**, using `FormSchema` as the system's single source of truth to uniformly drive UI, database schema, and business logic. This addresses the core pain points of traditional enterprise information system development: specifications scattered across three layers, redundant implementations, and difficulty in maintenance.

**Design Principles:**

- **Encapsulate complexity in the architecture layer** to simplify application-level development
- **Use structural definitions to drive cross-layer automation** (UI / DB / Logic)
- **Make definitions the primary development interface**, not code

### Pain Points of Traditional Enterprise Information System Development

| Pain Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Specifications scattered across layers | Adding a single field requires separate changes in UI / DTO / DB Migration, easily leading to inconsistencies |
| Scattered business logic | Different modules maintained by different engineers result in inconsistent styles and duplicated efforts |
| Customizations hard to standardize | Custom logic cannot be standardized, accumulating into unmanageable technical debt |

Polhem is designed with ERP as its complexity benchmark: form count, master-detail structure, numeric precision, and multi-company support are all sized to ERP requirements.

### Applicability Boundaries

| Suitable | Not Suitable |
|----------|--------------|
| Form-centric data applications (master/detail, auditing, validation) | High-concurrency, event-intensive systems (e-commerce, social media, gaming) |
| Multi-endpoint unified backend (Web / App / WinForms) | High-frequency microservice scenarios |
| Enterprise information systems (ERP, CRM, HRM — e.g. finance, procurement, warehouse, HR) | |

---

## 2. Architecture Pattern Positioning

Polhem adopts a **N-Tier + Clean Architecture + MVVM** hybrid pattern, borrowing the most suitable concepts from each pattern for enterprise information systems.

### Pattern Adoption Comparison

| Pattern | Adopted Concepts | Manifested in Polhem |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **N-Tier** | Clear layer boundaries, DataSet for cross-layer transfer, pragmatism | Distinct UI / API / BO / Repository / DB layers |
| **Clean Architecture** | Inward dependency direction, Domain Core as the most stable layer, Use Case isolation | FormSchema as Domain Core; BO as Use Case; Repository as Interface Adapter |
| **MVVM** | ViewModel isolates View from Model, two-way binding | FormSchema drives ViewModel structure; DataSet serves as Model |

### Pragmatic Trade-offs vs. Pure Clean Architecture

Pure Clean Architecture requires a strongly-typed Domain Entity for every business concept. ERP systems have a vast number of forms (hundreds or more), making the cost of writing Entity + Mapper for each one prohibitively high.

Polhem **replaces strongly-typed Entities with DataSet**, which brings:
- No need to define a corresponding Entity for every form
- FormSchema dynamically describes structure; adding a field requires no code changes
- Cross-layer transfer without mapping, eliminating unnecessary conversion layers

This is **pragmatic clean architecture** -- preserving dependency direction and separation of responsibilities while eliminating the unnecessary Entity modeling cost in form-centric applications.

---

## 3. FormSchema: The Definition Hub

`FormSchema` is the core of the Polhem architecture -- a **cross-layer shared structural description model**.

### Scope of Responsibility

- **Field definitions**: field name, data type, length, default value
- **Behavior definitions**: required, read-only, hidden, validation rules
- **Relationship definitions**: master/detail relationships between forms (FormSchemas)
- **SQL generation basis**: Repository CRUD dynamically generates SQL from FormSchema
- **UI derivation source**: FormLayout derives its layout structure from FormSchema **at design time**; the runtime renders the saved FormLayout definition and never derives one on the fly
- **DB derivation source**: TableSchema derives table structure from FormSchema
- **DbCategory routing**: `FormSchema.CategoryId` (required) determines which `DbCategory` the derived TableSchemas belong to (and thus the target connection / file path `TableSchema/{categoryId}/`)

### Definition Generation Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Generate FormSchema
        A1["AI-powered generation"]
        A2["Visual tool adjustments"]
    end

    A1 --> FD["FormSchema"]
    A2 --> FD

    FD --> FL["FormLayout"]
    FD --> DT["TableSchema"]

    FL --> UI["Web / Desktop / App dynamic forms"]
    DT --> DB["Database creation and maintenance"]
```

### Override Mechanism

FormLayout and TableSchema are derived from FormSchema at design time and saved as definition files, then support independent adjustments:

```
FormSchema updated
    |
Re-derive "default values"
    |
Diff against existing FormLayout / TableSchema
    |-- Unmodified parts -> Updated
    +-- Manually overridden parts -> Preserved
```

This ensures that when FormSchema evolves, manually adjusted custom settings are not overwritten.

### Tenant Customization Overlay

For deployments serving multiple tenants, Polhem adds a **per-tenant read-only customization overlay** on top of the base definitions. A `CustomizeId` (resolved from `SessionInfo.CustomizeId`, loaded from the company record at `EnterCompany`) drives an override layer for **Language / FormLayout / ProgramSettings / MenuSettings only** — `FormSchema` / `TableSchema` / settings stay tenant-agnostic so the database schema never diverges per tenant.

The overlay is **two independent read-only layers, never merged**: the base package cache is never mutated, and lookups overlay per key / progId / whole-file at the consumer. An empty `CustomizeId` short-circuits to pure base, bit-for-bit identical to a single-tenant deployment. See [ADR-016](../adr/adr-016-multitenant-customization-overlay.md).

---

## 4. FormLayout: UI Layer Definition

`FormLayout` is the UI-dimension projection of FormSchema, describing the visual configuration of a form. It is produced at design time and stored as a definition file: a form renders the stored layout, and a missing one is a configuration error rather than a cue to generate a layout at runtime.

### Positioning

| | XAML | FormLayout |
|--|--|--|
| Purpose | General-purpose UI description language | Designed specifically for standardized business forms |
| Complexity | High; must handle all UI scenarios | Low; only describes Master / Detail / Field structure |
| Cross-platform | Primarily WPF / MAUI / Avalonia | Unified across Web / Desktop / App |
| Generation | Hand-written | Auto-derived from FormSchema, then fine-tuned |

### Standardized Form Layout Pattern

```
+------------------------------------+
| Header (master fields)             |  <- Fixed area
+------------------------------------+
| Tab 1: Detail Grid                 |  <- Detail area (One2Many)
| Tab 2: Additional Information      |
+------------------------------------+
| Footer (summary fields)            |  <- Fixed area
+------------------------------------+
```

This constrained layout pattern allows FormLayout to fully describe forms with a far more concise syntax than XAML, and dynamically render across Web / Desktop / App.

---

## 5. TableSchema: Data Layer Definition

`TableSchema` is the database-dimension projection of FormSchema, responsible for describing and maintaining table structures.

### Responsibilities

- Derive table columns, types, and lengths from FormSchema
- Execute database DDL: CREATE TABLE / ALTER TABLE (add and modify columns)
- DBA can independently adjust indexes, precision, and default values

### Adjustment Example

```
FormSchema: field Amount, type Decimal
    | derived
TableSchema default: DECIMAL(18, 2)
    | DBA adjustment (independent of FormSchema)
TableSchema actual: DECIMAL(24, 6)  +  INDEX  +  DEFAULT 0
```

FormSchema does not need to know database-layer optimization details; TableSchema can evolve independently.

---

## 6. DataSet as DTO

Polhem uses ADO.NET `DataSet` as the cross-layer Data Transfer Object (DTO), rather than custom strongly-typed POCOs.

### Rationale

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Natural Master-Detail shape** | A form's master and detail tables travel as sibling `DataTable`s in one DataSet, which is the shape nearly all business forms take. The framework does not build `DataRelation`s to link them: a detail row carries `sys_master_rowid` pointing at the master row's `sys_rowid`, and the FormSchema declares which table is the master (see `src/Polhem.Repository/Form/DataFormRepository.cs` and `src/Polhem.Definition/Forms/FormRowDefaults.cs`) |
| **Self-describing structure** | DataSet carries its own schema; no additional type definitions needed during transfer |
| **Multi-table transport** | A single DataSet can carry a master table plus multiple detail tables, transferring an entire transaction's data at once |
| **Cross-layer consistency** | UI layer, BO layer, and Repository layer share the same object; no mapping required |

### Design Boundary

DataSet is purely a **data container** and contains no business logic whatsoever. All logic resides in the BO; DataSet only provides data.

---

## 7. Business Object (BO)

`Business Object` (BO) is the core of business logic, corresponding to the Use Case layer in Clean Architecture.

### Responsibilities

- Provide methods corresponding to form operations (Save, Delete, Validate, Query...)
- Execute data validation based on FormSchema
- Coordinate DataSet (data) and Repository (data access)
- **Never access the database directly**; always go through Repository

### Typical Method Structure

```csharp
public class SalesOrderBO : BusinessObject
{
    // CRUD: via FormSchema-driven Repository (auto-routed to the right DB)
    public void Save(DataSet ds)
    {
        // 1. Validate DataSet data based on FormSchema
        // 2. Use the BO base helper — DB routing is automatic
        var repository = CreateDataFormRepository(ProgId);
        // 3. Repository executes INSERT / UPDATE on the resolved database
    }

    // Reports: BO selects DB scope explicitly, implements SQL directly
    public DataSet GetSalesSummaryReport(ReportFilter filter)
    {
        var dbId = ResolveDatabaseId(DbScope.Company);   // type-safe, no magic string
        var repo = new SalesReportRepo(
            Services.GetRequiredService<IDbAccessFactory>(), dbId);
        // ... custom SQL via repo
    }
}
```

A single BO can mix both Repository strategies; the caller does not need to know which track is used underneath.

### Session Lifecycle and Database Scope

BO method execution is bracketed by a two-phase session lifecycle (see [ADR-012](../adr/adr-012-session-company-context.md)):

```
Login(account, password)   ──→  Logged-in (SessionInfo.CompanyId = null)
EnterCompany(companyId)    ──→  In-company (SessionInfo.CompanyId = ...)
LeaveCompany()             ──→  back to Logged-in
Logout()                   ──→  Session destroyed (implicitly clears CompanyId)
```

Three logical database scopes (`DbScope.Common` / `DbScope.Log` / `DbScope.Company`) map to physical databases via `IRepositoryDatabaseRouter`. `Common` and `Log` route to fixed databaseIds and can be used pre-EnterCompany; `Company` requires the session to have entered a company.

---

## 8. Repository Dual-Track Strategy

Repository adopts a **dual-track parallel** design, choosing the appropriate implementation based on the nature of the operation.

### Dual-Track Comparison

| Track | Applicable Operations | SQL Source | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **FormSchema-driven** ([details](formschema-data-access.md)) | CRUD (create, update, delete) | Dynamically generated from FormSchema | Define once, auto-sync; no hand-written SQL |
| **AnyCode** | Reports, analytical queries, batch operations | Written by BO | Full control; complex JOINs, aggregations, performance tuning |

### Why This Division

Business-form CRUD operations are highly homogeneous; nearly all forms follow:

```
Validate required -> Validate format -> Validate relationships -> INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
```

This 80% of workload is handled by FormSchema-driven operations -- developers only need to define, not write code.

Reports and batch operations often involve multi-table JOINs + GROUP BY + dynamic conditions, or require control over transaction boundaries and batching strategies. Forcing them into FormSchema would only add unnecessary complexity.

### Shared Infrastructure

Both tracks share underlying connection management and transaction management:

```
FormSchema-driven Repository --+
                                +--> Shared UnitOfWork / ConnectionFactory
AnyCode Repository -------------+
```

This ensures cross-track operations (e.g., CRUD on the main order + batch inventory update) can collaborate within **the same transaction**, keeping commit / rollback consistent.

---

## 9. MVVM Integration

Polhem integrates with the frontend using the MVVM pattern, with FormSchema directly driving the ViewModel binding structure.

### Layer Mapping

| MVVM Role | Polhem Counterpart | Description |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Model** | DataSet | Carries form data; no logic |
| **ViewModel** | Derived from FormSchema | Field behavior, validation rules, binding structure |
| **View** | Web / Desktop / App | Dynamically rendered via FormLayout |

### Data Flow

```
User interaction
    |^ (two-way binding)
ViewModel (binding structure derived from FormSchema)
    |^
DataSet (Model)
    |
BO.Save(DataSet)
    |
Repository -> Database
```

When FormSchema changes, the ViewModel binding structure updates automatically; the View requires no manual adjustments.

---

## 10. NoCode / LowCode / AnyCode Evolution Axis

Polhem provides three levels of development depth along a single evolution axis -- they are complementary, not mutually exclusive technology stacks.

### Three-Level Comparison

| Mode | Flexibility | Implementation | Applicable Scenarios |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **NoCode** | Medium | FormSchema -> FormLayout + TableSchema generated at design time | Standard workflows, data-oriented forms |
| **LowCode** | High | Events, conditions, and rules to extend BO | Light customization logic |
| **AnyCode** | Full | Custom UI / BO methods / AnyCode Repository | Complex logic, cross-module integration, reports and batch operations |

### Evolution Cycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[NoCode: Definition-driven implementation]
    --> B[LowCode: Event/condition extensions]
    --> C[AnyCode: Advanced logic]
    --> D[Architecture feedback: Patterns distilled back to definition layer]
    --> A
```

Common patterns discovered during each AnyCode customization can be distilled back into FormSchema or BO base classes, making the next development cycle more automated.

## 12. Key Design Decision Summary

| Decision Point | Choice | Rationale |
|----------------|--------|-----------|
| **DTO type** | ADO.NET DataSet | Form Master-Detail structure; cross-layer consistency without mapping |
| **Domain core** | FormSchema (not Entity) | Vast number of ERP forms; dynamic definitions are superior to modeling each one individually |
| **Logic layer** | BO (independent of data) | Clean Arch Use Case; does not depend on DB implementation details |
| **CRUD SQL** | Dynamically generated from FormSchema | Define once; adding fields auto-syncs |
| **Complex queries/batch** | AnyCode Repository | Reports/batch require full control; the framework should not constrain complex scenarios |
| **UI definition** | FormLayout (not XAML) | Designed for standardized form layouts; constrained structure, more concise syntax |
| **DB maintenance** | TableSchema derivation + adjustable | Auto-sync with definitions; DBA can still independently optimize indexes and types |
| **Architecture hybrid** | N-Tier + Clean Arch + MVVM | Borrowing the most suitable concepts for enterprise information systems from each; not forcing pure theoretical application |
| **Audit trail** | Opt-in `st_log_*` tables via `IAuditLogWriter` (`AuditLogOptions`) | Five-axis data trail — login / change (DiffGram before-after) / access / API+DB anomaly; background, best-effort, self-sufficient (denormalised) log rows |
