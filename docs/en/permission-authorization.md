# Permission & Authorization Guide

[繁體中文](../zh-TW/permission-authorization.md) · [← Docs Index](README.md)

Polhem permissions span **three dimensions**, applied at **two enforcement points** — the **back end** is the authoritative security boundary; the **front end** degrades UI elements as a UX affordance (never a security boundary):

| Dimension | Question | Back end | Front end |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Action** | Can this user perform this *action* on the model? | ✅ authoritative gate — `Can(model, action)` | ✅ toolbar command / button state |
| **Record (row)** | On *which rows* may they do it? | ✅ authoritative scope filter + write re-query | — |
| **Field (column)** | May they *see* / *edit* this sensitive field? | — *(not masked server-side)* | ✅ hide (no `Read`) / lock (no `Update`) |

The **Action** dimension applies at *both* points: the back end enforces it at the method layer (the real boundary), and the front end mirrors it as command/button state so users are not offered actions they cannot perform. **Record** is back-end only. **Field** is front-end only — a UX affordance, not a data boundary (see the caveat in [section 10](#10-enabling-capability-in-a-host-app-opt-in)).

Both back-end dimensions run entirely from in-memory snapshots at request time (the database is touched only when loading the caches, at login, on `EnterCompany`, or when configuration changes). Authorization is **orthogonal** to `ApiAccessControlAttribute` (which governs encryption level and whether login is required). See [ADR-019](../adr/adr-019-permission-authorization-model.md) for the design rationale.

All three dimensions are **company-scoped**. Assets that belong to the installation rather than to any company — API keys, and whatever a deployment adds later — are governed by a separate, parallel decision described in **Part 3**.

---

# Part 1 — Back-end enforcement (Action + Record)

The Action and Record dimensions are the authoritative gate. Both run entirely from in-memory snapshots and are decoupled from forms.

## 1. Define permission models

A **permission model** is a business entity (e.g. `PurchaseOrder`), deliberately distinct from a form's `progId`. Models live in a single registry (`PermissionModels`, `DefineType.PermissionModels`). Each model declares, per action, a default record-scope strategy:

```xml
<PermissionModels>
  <PermissionModel ModelId="PurchaseOrder" DisplayName="Purchase Order">
    <Rules>
      <PermissionRule Action="Read"   Scope="DeptAndSub" />
      <PermissionRule Action="Update" Scope="Own" />
      <PermissionRule Action="Delete" Scope="Own" />
      <PermissionRule Action="Create" Scope="All" />
      <!-- Print / Export omit Scope → inherit the model's Read scope -->
    </Rules>
  </PermissionModel>
</PermissionModels>
```

- `ModelId` is a PascalCase business entity. **One model may be consumed by many forms** (`PO001` create, `PO002` query, `PO009` report all reference `PurchaseOrder`) — granting once enables all three.
- The model is bound to neither a table nor a column. Scope strategies are pure semantics; the concrete columns come from the FormSchema (next section).

## 2. Bind a form to the model

A `FormSchema` declares which model it consumes, and marks which **master-table** columns play the owner / department role:

```xml
<FormSchema ProgId="PO001" PermissionModelId="PurchaseOrder" ...>
  <Tables>
    <FormTable TableName="PO001" ...>
      <Fields>
        <FormField FieldName="buyer_rowid" Caption="Buyer"      ScopeRole="Owner" />
        <FormField FieldName="dept_rowid"  Caption="Department" ScopeRole="Dept" />
        <!-- ... other fields ... -->
      </Fields>
    </FormTable>
  </Tables>
</FormSchema>
```

Rules:

- `ScopeRole` is **master-table only**. Marking it on a detail table is reported by `PermissionBindingValidator` (see [Definition validation](#definition-validation-host-invoked)) — record scope is decided on the master record; details follow it.
- **A master table may mark multiple `Owner` / `Dept` columns** — each contributes an OR branch. For example a transfer form marks both a from-department (`from_dept`) and a to-department (`to_dept`), so *both* departments' managers can see the record.
- An empty `PermissionModelId` makes the form **unscoped** — both back-end layers are skipped (gradual adoption / backward compatible).

## 3. Grant roles

Roles, grants and assignments live in each **company database** (`st_` framework tables, per-company config):

| Table | Columns | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `st_role` | `sys_id`, `sys_name` | a role (a unit you assign) |
| `st_role_grant` | `role_id`, `model_id`, `action`, `scope` | one (role, model, action) the role is granted, plus its record scope |
| `st_user_role` | `user_id`, `role_id` | user ↔ role assignment (`user_id` is `st_user.sys_id`) |

`st_role_grant` is **per-action**: the presence of a row is the layer-1 grant; its `scope` (a `ScopeStrategy`) drives layer-2. This is what lets a role *read* its whole department but *update* only its own records.

```sql
-- "Buyer" can read the department-and-sub PurchaseOrders, but only update/delete its own:
INSERT INTO st_role_grant (role_id, model_id, action, scope) VALUES
  ('Buyer', 'PurchaseOrder', 2 /*Read*/,   4 /*DeptAndSub*/),
  ('Buyer', 'PurchaseOrder', 4 /*Update*/, 2 /*Own*/),
  ('Buyer', 'PurchaseOrder', 8 /*Delete*/, 2 /*Own*/);
-- scope = ScopeStrategy: Inherit=0, All=1, Own=2, Dept=3, DeptAndSub=4
-- action = PermissionAction (flags): Create=1, Read=2, Update=4, Delete=8, Print=16, Export=32
```

`scope = Inherit (0)` defers to the model's per-action default (section 1).

## 4. Link users to employees (for department scope)

Department / owner scope needs to resolve **the current user → their department**. A user (`st_user`, common DB) is linked to an employee (`st_employee`, company DB) via `st_employee.user_rowid`:

```
st_user.sys_rowid  ──(st_employee.user_rowid)──▶  st_employee  ──(dept_rowid)──▶  st_department
```

On `EnterCompany`, the framework resolves `user → employee → department` once and snapshots `UserRowId`, `EmployeeRowId`, `DeptRowId` onto the session. Scope filtering then runs zero-DB. A user without a linked employee gets empty employee/department — `Own` still matches their `UserRowId`, while `Dept`/`DeptAndSub` match nothing (fail-closed).

## 5. How enforcement behaves

### Layer 1 — action gate

`FormBusinessObject` checks `(model, action)` before running:

- `GetList` / `GetData` → `Read`
- `Save` → per row by `RowState`: `Added`→`Create`, `Modified`→`Update`, `Deleted`→`Delete`
- `Delete` → `Delete`

Multiple roles **OR-merge** (capabilities accrue). A failing check throws `ForbiddenException`.

### Layer 2 — record scope

**Reads** (`GetList`, `GetData`) AND a scope filter into the query. Out-of-scope rows are filtered out; an out-of-scope single-row fetch returns `null` (indistinguishable from "not found", so a caller cannot probe records they may not see).

**Writes** (`Update`, `Delete`) are gated by an **authoritative re-query** against the database — `WHERE sys_rowid = id AND <scope>` — *not* by evaluating the submitted payload. A forged DataSet cannot relabel its way past the boundary.

- `Save` re-checks only an existing master record (any master `RowState` other than `Added`). A details-only edit leaves the master `Unchanged` but still counts as an `Update`.
- `Delete(rowId)` returns 0 and cascades nothing when the row is out of scope.
- **`Create` is not scope-checked** — a new row has no existing scope to violate; creation is governed by the action grant.
- Scope is **master-only**: once the master passes, the whole record (details included) persists as a unit.

### Scope strategies

| Strategy | Read filter (and write re-query) |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| `All` | no restriction |
| `Own` | `ownerField IN {UserRowId, EmployeeRowId}` |
| `Dept` | `deptField = DeptRowId` **OR** Own |
| `DeptAndSub` | `deptField IN (department + descendants)` **OR** Own |
| `Inherit` | the model's per-action default (else its Read scope, else `All`) |

- `Dept` / `DeptAndSub` **implicitly include `Own`** — a user always sees records they own.
- **Multiple scope columns**: when the master marks several `Owner` / `Dept` columns, the strategy **OR-unions across all of them** — e.g. a transfer form's `from_dept` and `to_dept` each `IN` the subtree, so a record shows to a manager of either department.
- **Multi-role merge**: if *any* role grants `All` for the action → no filter; otherwise the restrictive strategies are **OR-unioned**.
- The `Own` owner column may hold either a user row id or an employee row id (e.g. the *creator* vs the *employee on a leave form*); the `IN {UserRowId, EmployeeRowId}` set covers both, and a user need not map to an employee.

---

# Part 2 — Front-end capability (Action commands + Field)

The front end degrades UI elements from a per-model **capability snapshot**, so users are not offered commands or shown sensitive data they lack permission for. It surfaces **two** of the three dimensions: the **Action** dimension as toolbar command / button state, and the **Field** dimension as sensitive-field hiding / locking. This is **UX only** — the back end (Part 1) remains the authoritative boundary.

## 6. Mark sensitive fields

The Field dimension is **opt-in**: mark only the fields that need controlling. Most fields carry no marker and always render per their layout.

```xml
<FormField FieldName="unit_cost" Caption="Unit Cost" SensitiveCategory="Cost" />
```

`SensitiveCategory` (default `None` = not controlled) is a **named, finite classification** — `Amount`, `Cost`, `PersonalData` — parallel to `ScopeRole`. The designer picks a category rather than inventing an id, so the set is closed and checkable. It applies to **any field**, master or detail grid column.

## 7. Well-known category models

Each non-`None` category maps **by convention** to a permission model whose id equals the category name (`Cost` → the `"Cost"` model). These are ordinary entries in the same `PermissionModels` registry — declare and grant them like any other model. `PermissionBindingValidator` reports an error when a marked category has no matching model (see [Definition validation](#definition-validation-host-invoked)).

```sql
-- A viewer may see cost but not change it (Read only); an editor may change it (Read + Update).
-- Editing requires Read too — Update without Read leaves the field hidden.
INSERT INTO st_role_grant (role_id, model_id, action, scope) VALUES
  ('CostViewer', 'Cost', 2 /*Read*/,   1 /*All*/),
  ('CostEditor', 'Cost', 2 /*Read*/,   1 /*All*/),
  ('CostEditor', 'Cost', 4 /*Update*/, 1 /*All*/);
```

The category gate is **company-wide and orthogonal to the form's own model**: seeing a `Cost` column depends on `Cost.Read`, *independent* of `PurchaseOrder.Read`. A user may be permitted to read purchase orders yet still have their cost columns hidden. This matches ERP practice — cost/amount/PII visibility is a data-classification concern that should be consistent across every form, granted once.

## 8. How the capability snapshot reaches the client

On `EnterCompany`, the back end computes the per-model action mask for the session's roles (`CompanyRolePermissions.GetAllowedByModel`) and returns it on `EnterCompanyResponse.Capabilities` — a `Dictionary<modelId, PermissionAction>` — riding the existing `EnterCompany` round-trip, so there is **no extra request**. Only models the user holds a grant on appear in the map.

## 9. How the client degrades

`ClientInfo.Capabilities` caches the snapshot (nullable), and `Polhem.UI.Core.Permissions.ElementCapabilityResolver` (a pure, UI-agnostic resolver) reads it:

- **`null` → capability inactive → nothing is degraded.** An app that never enters a company, or does not use permissions, renders exactly as before.
- **Non-null → active.** A model absent from the map means *no permission* on it.

Two element kinds consume the resolver:

- **Commands** (toolbar buttons). Each button is tagged at creation with the `PermissionAction` it needs (`New`→`Create`, `Save`→`Create|Update`, `Delete`→`Delete`, `View`→`Read`); the resolver's `Can(...)` checks the form's `PermissionModelId` with **any-of** semantics (`Save` shows if the user holds either `Create` or `Update`). An un-permitted button is hidden. This is the front-end **projection of the Action dimension** as UX.
- **Sensitive fields.** `ResolveField(...)` reads the field's `SensitiveCategory`, looks up the category model, and degrades on **two independent sub-gates** — `Read` controls *visibility*, `Update` controls *editability* — so a field can be viewable but not editable. Applied to master fields and detail grid columns alike.

  | `<category>.Read` | `<category>.Update` | Result |
  |:---:|:---:|---|
  | ✗ | (either) | **Hidden** — the column is not rendered |
  | ✓ | ✗ | **Visible, read-only** — *e.g. see the cost, cannot change it* |
  | ✓ | ✓ | **Visible, editable** |

  Hidden wins over read-only — there is no point marking editability on a field you cannot see.

> **Detail grid actions (add/edit/delete rows) are not capability-gated.** A detail belongs to the same aggregate as its master, so whether its rows can be edited follows the form's edit mode — and the permission to enter that edit mode was already enforced by the toolbar command. Only the grid's sensitive *columns* are degraded.

Degradation never mutates cached definitions: the client applies it to the per-view generated layout, narrowing visibility/editability only.

## 10. Enabling capability in a host app (opt-in)

Capability is **inert until wired**, so existing apps are unaffected. To turn it on:

1. Declare the well-known category models (`Amount` / `Cost` / `PersonalData`) in `PermissionModels` and grant them (section 7).
2. After `SystemApiConnector.EnterCompanyAsync`, hand the response to the client cache:
   ```csharp
   var response = await ClientInfo.SystemApiConnector.EnterCompanyAsync(companyId);
   ClientInfo.ApplyEnterCompanyResult(response);   // caches the capability snapshot
   ClientInfo.ResetDefineCache();                  // (existing) drop stale tenant defines
   ```
3. On `LeaveCompany`, clear it: `ClientInfo.ClearCompanyContext();`.

> **Caveat — the Field dimension is UX, not a data boundary.** `GetList` / `GetData` still return the sensitive column's value; the client merely hides or locks it. A client that bypasses the standard UI could still receive the raw value over the API. Treat field permission as *presentation*. Anything that must never leave the server belongs behind an **Action** or **Record** boundary (Part 1), or its own permission model — not solely a `SensitiveCategory`. Server-side column masking is a separate future concern (see Non-goals).

# Part 3 — Deployment-level administration (outside the company model)

Everything above is scoped to a company: roles, grants and the department tree all live in **each company's own database**, and `ICompanyAuthorizationService.Can` returns `false` when the session has entered no company.

Some assets belong to the **installation** rather than to any company — an API key identifies a calling *application*, not a tenant. Guarding those with company permissions would mean one tenant's administrator could act for all of them. They are therefore governed by a separate, parallel decision.

| | Company authorization | Deployment authorization |
|---|---|---|
| Interface | `ICompanyAuthorizationService.Can(token, modelId, action)` | `IDeploymentAuthorizationService.Can(token, action)` |
| Question | May this user do X **inside company C**? | May this user do X **to the installation**? |
| Identity source | `st_role` / `st_role_grant` / `st_user_role` in each company database | `st_user.deployment_admin` in the common database |
| Requires a company | Yes — no company context, no permission | No — by definition there is none |

> **The two never grant each other anything.** A deployment administrator gains **no data rights in any company**: reading or writing a company's records still runs the Action and Record gates of Part 1, which consult that company's roles and know nothing about the flag. A company administrator gains nothing here. Neither check falls back to the other.

## 11. What deployment authorization covers

`DeploymentAction` is a deliberately small enumeration; today it has one member:

| Action | Gated operation |
|--------|-----------------|
| `ManageApiKey` | `SystemBO.CreateApiKey` — issuing an API key |

`CreateApiKey` runs the check only for **remote** callers. An in-process call passes without an administrator, which is what keeps a fresh deployment able to mint its first key on the host before any administrator exists.

The check reads the flag from the database **on every call**, deliberately unlike the company path (which answers from cache and touches no database). Deployment operations are rare, and revoking an administrator has to take effect immediately — any cached form of the flag would delay it.

## 12. Appointing an administrator

`SystemBO.SetDeploymentAdmin(userId, isDeploymentAdmin)` is the **only** write path to `st_user.deployment_admin`, and it is `LocalOnly`: the first administrator is appointed on the host, after which appointments can be made through whatever administration surface the deployment builds on top of it.

The framework enforces "only write path" at runtime, not by convention: `ProtectedFields` lists the column, and the FormSchema-driven write path (`DataFormRepository.Save`) strips it from every INSERT and UPDATE **even if a form declares it**. Without that, a deployment that built its own user-maintenance form over `st_user` would have handed its ordinary users a route to promote themselves. Reads are unaffected — a form may display the column, it simply cannot store it.

`st_user.password` is protected the same way, and for a sharper reason: the column grants the privilege of *being* the user, and its contents are load-bearing — `PasswordHasher.VerifyPassword` parses the iteration count, salt and hash out of the stored string. A form writing that column would be storing values the verifier never produced. The framework itself has no write path for it at all.

> **Upgrading:** a deployment that set passwords through its own maintenance form over `st_user` will find that column silently dropped from the save after this change. Move it to a dedicated operation that hashes what it stores; a form has no way to produce a value `VerifyPassword` will accept.

The framework ships no `st_user` rows, so seeding a first administrator on a brand-new deployment is the deployment's own decision; the column defaults to "not an administrator" either way.

## 13. Audit trail

Deployment operations are recorded on the change axis (`st_log_change`) under the `System` prog id, with `source` naming the operation (`System.SetDeploymentAdmin`, `System.CreateApiKey`) and the acting user denormalised into `user_id` / `user_name` as with any other audit row. The `changes_xml` payload carries before/after values, so the trail distinguishes a **grant** from a **revoke** — both are an `Update` and would otherwise be indistinguishable.

Two properties are worth knowing:

- **Always marked sensitive** (`is_sensitive`), so a log filtered down to what matters still shows them.
- **Not subject to `AuditLogOptions.ChangeEnabled`.** That switch exists so a deployment can opt out of the volume of ordinary business-data history; appointing an administrator is neither ordinary nor voluminous. Turning it off leaves these entries in place — only turning off `AuditLogOptions.Enabled` entirely stops them.

An API key audit entry records the key's id, name, type, contact and expiry. It **never** records the secret or its hash: the log database is a separate store with its own, usually wider, readership.

## 14. Upgrading an existing deployment

1. **The column arrives automatically.** `st_user.deployment_admin` is added by the framework's schema upgrade (an `ALTER … ADD`); existing rows take the default and are *not* administrators. No manual DDL.
2. **Unless you have overridden the table's definition.** The framework reads table definitions only from your `DefinePath` at runtime. If your deployment ships its own `st_user.TableSchema.xml`, add the column there — the framework's embedded default is not consulted. (See [Framework-Reserved Names §3](framework-reserved-names.md#3-consumer-guidelines).)
3. **Appoint the first administrator on the host**, through an in-process call to `SetDeploymentAdmin`. Until then no remote caller can mint an API key, while local calls continue to work exactly as before the upgrade.

---

## Definition validation (host-invoked)

`PermissionBindingValidator.Validate(schemas, models)` checks the binding between forms and the
permission registry: every `FormSchema.PermissionModelId` references an existing model, `ScopeRole`
is marked on master tables only, and every non-`None` `SensitiveCategory` has a matching well-known
model. It returns one message per violation and an empty list when the definitions are valid.

**The framework does not call it for you.** There is no automatic load-time scan — an invalid
binding will not stop the application from starting; it surfaces later as a permission check that
silently does nothing (an empty `PermissionModelId` means *unscoped*, so a typo in a model id
degrades to "no enforcement" rather than to an error). Invoke the validator yourself where a
failure is cheap to act on: at host startup, in a deployment smoke test, or in a CI step over the
definitions in your `DefinePath`.

```csharp
var errors = PermissionBindingValidator.Validate(allFormSchemas, permissionModels);
if (errors.Count > 0)
    throw new InvalidOperationException(string.Join(Environment.NewLine, errors));
```

## Caching & invalidation

- Role/grant/user-role tables load into a per-company `CompanyRolePermissions` cache; the department tree into a per-company `DepartmentTree` cache. Both are DB-sourced and evicted via the common cache-notify poller.
- `SessionInfo` holds the request-time snapshot (`Roles`, `UserRowId`, `EmployeeRowId`, `DeptRowId`), populated at `EnterCompany`, cleared at `LeaveCompany` / `Logout`.
- The client capability snapshot (`ClientInfo.Capabilities`) is also point-in-time: populated at `EnterCompany`, cleared on `LeaveCompany` / token change. Re-enter the company to refresh it after a grant change.
- Snapshots are point-in-time: configuration changed mid-session is reflected for cache-backed checks (`Can` reads the live cache) but role/employee/department snapshots on an already-entered session update on the next `EnterCompany`.

## Transport & credential hardening (production)

- **Require HTTPS.** The login request carries the password under `PayloadFormat.Encoded` (serialize + compress + Base64 — *not* encryption); the RSA handshake only protects the session key the server returns. Transport confidentiality therefore rests entirely on TLS. Serve every production endpoint over HTTPS (and enable HSTS); never expose the JSON-RPC endpoint over plain HTTP.
- **Override the API key validator.** The default `ApiAuthorizationValidator` only checks that the `X-Api-Key` header is non-empty, not its value — real authentication runs on the Bearer access token. If you treat the API key as an access gate, override `ApiServiceOptions.AuthorizationValidator` to compare the key against a configured set with a constant-time comparison. `UsePolhemFramework` logs a startup warning while the default validator is in place.

## Non-goals

- **Declarative custom-command model** — standard toolbar commands are tagged in code (section 9); Print / Export / Approve as *data-defined* `FormLayout` elements are not modelled yet. When added, custom commands will carry their own opt-in `PermissionAction`.
- **Back-end field masking** — the Field dimension is front-end UX. Server-side masking of sensitive columns (so their values never leave the server) is not yet implemented; use an Action/Record boundary for hard data confidentiality today.
