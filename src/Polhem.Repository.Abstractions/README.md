# Polhem.Repository.Abstractions

> Abstract interface library for the data access layer, defining Repository and Provider contracts.

[繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

## Architecture Position

- **Layer**: Data Access Layer (contracts)
- **Position in the dependency graph**: see [Project Dependency Map](../../docs/en/dependency-map.md). Not enumerated here — the csproj files are the authority, and a prose copy in every package README drifts with nothing to catch it. These did: `Polhem.Hosting` was missing as a dependent from four of them for months after it was extracted.

## Target Framework

- `net10.0` -- access to modern runtime APIs and performance improvements

## Key Features

### Repository Contracts

- `ISessionRepository` -- session lifecycle operations: create, retrieve, and validate user sessions via access tokens
- `IDatabaseRepository` -- database administration operations: connection testing and table schema upgrades

### Factory Contract

- `IRepositoryFactory` -- the single entry point for obtaining a repository, on either axis:
  `CreateFormRepository<T>(accessToken, progId)` for the progId axis (the type varies per progId)
  and `Create<T>(accessToken)` for the framework axis (fixed types named by their interface).
  Both are generic, so adding a repository never widens the interface.

### Form Repository Contracts

- `IDataFormRepository` -- repository interface for data form CRUD operations

### Database Routing Contract

- `IRepositoryDatabaseRouter` -- resolves the physical databaseId a repository should use for a logical `DbScope` (`Common` / `Log` / `Company`) and the current session's access token

## Key Public APIs

| Interface / Class | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `ISessionRepository` | Session persistence: `GetSession` / `InsertSession` / `UpdateSession` / `DeleteSession` / `DeleteExpiredSessions` |
| `IDatabaseRepository` | Connection testing (`TestConnection`) and schema migration (`UpgradeTableSchema`) |
| `IRepositoryFactory` | The single entry point for every repository, on both axes |
| `IDataFormRepository` | Contract for data form data access |
| `IRepositoryDatabaseRouter` | Resolves the physical databaseId for a logical `DbScope` and access token |

## Design Conventions

- **Repository Pattern** -- each domain concern (session, database, form) has a dedicated repository interface.
- **One factory, two axes** -- `IRepositoryFactory` resolves progId-bound repositories through the registry and framework repositories by their interface. It replaced three factories, one of which grew a method per system table.
- **Passive contracts, injected via DI** -- this project defines contracts only; there is no static holder or service locator. Concrete implementations are registered in the DI container and injected where needed, rather than resolved from a static entry point or read from a static `BackendConfiguration`.
- **Nullable reference types** enabled (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`).
