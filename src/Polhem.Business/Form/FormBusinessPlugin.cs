    /// <para>
    /// <b>One class, one stage.</b> A plugin is bound to a progId in
    /// <see cref="Polhem.Definition.Settings.PluginSettings"/>, and each binding names both the type
    /// and the one stage it runs at. The class must override exactly that stage and no other; any
    /// disagreement between the two refuses to load. A requirement spanning several stages is
    /// therefore several classes — the stages differ in kind (a check before saving, a side effect
    /// after it), and the file is readable for what runs where.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>One instance per operation, and no state carried between stages.</b> A single
    /// <c>Save</c> (or <c>Delete</c>) constructs the plugin at most once, and instances are never
    /// shared between calls, so no locking is needed. Because a plugin has only one stage, there is
    /// no later stage of the same call to hand state to: what an <c>After</c> class needs it must
    /// read or recompute for itself.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>Every stage runs outside the database transaction.</b> The transaction opens and commits
    /// inside the repository, within the business object's <c>DoSave</c> / <c>DoDelete</c> step. A
    /// plugin therefore cannot make its work atomic with the record — logic that must be belongs in
    /// a repository subclass. For the full contract see the business object's own extension points.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>Throwing aborts the operation.</b> Use
    /// <see cref="Polhem.Base.Exceptions.UserMessageException"/> for a message meant to reach the end
    /// user. At an <c>After</c> stage the data is already committed, so an exception fails the call
    /// against saved data: side effects there must tolerate retries, or be queued rather than
    /// performed inline. A plugin that talks to another system should decide for itself whether a
    /// failure warrants aborting the user's operation — do not let a remote system's availability
    /// determine whether a record can be saved.
