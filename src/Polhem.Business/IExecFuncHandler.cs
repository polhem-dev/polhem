    /// a receiver type other than <c>object</c> — an extension method on <c>object</c> would appear on
    /// every type in the consumer's IntelliSense — and it is how rule POLHEM3003 recognises a handler in

    /// <para>
    /// WARNING: implementing this interface guarantees nothing at compile time. A type carrying no
    /// dispatchable method at all still satisfies it. What keeps the surface safe is that dispatch is
