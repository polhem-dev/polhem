# Polhem.UI.Avalonia

[繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

Avalonia desktop control library (Windows / macOS / Linux). Renders FormSchema-driven forms with a set of native-control subclasses deeply bound to the definition layer, all backed by the `FormDataObject` view-model.

## Architecture Position

**Layer**: UI (desktop)

Belongs to the `Polhem.UI.*` family: connects to the backend through the `ClientInfo` static singleton (`Polhem.UI.Core`) with a per-process token model. Depends on `Polhem.Api.Client` for connectors and `Polhem.Definition` for schemas and layouts.

## Target Framework

Single `net10.0` TFM. Lower-bound pins: `Avalonia 12.0.0` + `Avalonia.Controls.DataGrid 12.0.0`; hosts may bring a newer `Avalonia 12.0.x` transitively. The library ships no theme — the host picks one (Semi.Avalonia, Fluent, …); every control keeps the host theme through `StyleKeyOverride`.

## Key Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `FormView` | Top-level container: list (`GridControl`) + master/detail form + New / Save / Delete toolbar. Renders the master sections of a `FormLayout` (one field editor per `LayoutField`) followed by the detail grids (`FormLayout.Details`) directly — there is no separate `DynamicForm` control; `DetailEditMode` picks the detail editing model. Resolves `Schema` / `FormConnector` / `AccessToken` from `ClientInfo` when the host sets only `ProgId`. |
| `GridControl` | `ContentControl` hosting a `DataGrid` (exposed as `InnerGrid`), driven by a `LayoutGrid`; implements `IBindTableControl` / `IUIControl`. Cell rendering goes through `DataGridTemplateColumn` + `FuncDataTemplate<DataRowView>` (see ADR-020). |
| Field editors (`TextEdit` / `MemoEdit` / `ButtonEdit` / `DateEdit` / `YearMonthEdit` / `DropDownEdit` / `CheckEdit`) | One per `ControlType`; native-control subclasses implementing `IBindFieldControl` / `IUIControl`, auto-applying `FormField` metadata (MaxLength, ListItems). |
| `FormScope` | Attached inherited properties (`DataObject` / `FormMode`): set once on a container and every descendant editor with a `FieldName` binds itself. |
| `GridEditMode` | UI-layer editing model for grids: `InCell` (cell editing, ADR-021 hybrid strategy) or `EditForm` (read-only grid + popup row editing). |
| `RowEditPanel` / `RowEditDialog` | EditForm-mode editing surface built from the field editors; commits or cancels through the buffered row-edit protocol. |
| `FormDataObject` | The view-model: carries the `DataSet`, bridges ADO.NET table events into `FieldValueChanged` / dirty tracking, exposes the async CRUD round-trips and the buffered row-edit protocol (`BeginRowEdit` / `CommitRowEdit` / `CancelRowEdit`). |
| `FileEndpointStorage` | File-backed `IEndpointStorage` + `IApiKeyStorage`; persists the endpoint at `LocalApplicationData/<appName>/endpoint.txt` and the API key at `apikey.txt` beside it. |

## Usage

```csharp
// Host bootstrap — wire the storages BEFORE any UI control instantiates.
ApiClientInfo.SupportedConnectTypes = SupportedConnectTypes.Remote;
var storage = new FileEndpointStorage("MyApp");
ClientInfo.EndpointStorage = storage;
ClientInfo.ApiKeyStorage = storage;
// Seeds empty storage on first run; the stored key wins afterwards, so changing it
// is a settings change rather than a rebuild.
ClientInfo.ApplyApiKey("my-app");
```

```xml
<!-- Full form: one ProgId drives schema, layout, connector and data. -->
<polhem:FormView ProgId="Employee" />

<!-- Hand-written form: set the ambient scope once, editors bind by FieldName. -->
<StackPanel ed:FormScope.DataObject="{Binding Data}">
    <ed:TextEdit FieldName="emp_name" />
    <ed:DateEdit FieldName="hire_date" />
</StackPanel>
```

## Design Notes

- Every control subclass overrides `StyleKeyOverride` to its native base type so the host theme keeps applying (a missing override renders the control invisible).
- `FieldValueChanged` is bridged from the ADO.NET `DataTable` events — any write path (editors, grid cells, direct `DataRow` writes) publishes; no writer raises events manually.
- DataGrid binding and editing strategies are recorded in [ADR-020](../../docs/adr/adr-020-avalonia-datagrid-binding-strategy.md) and [ADR-021](../../docs/adr/adr-021-avalonia-datagrid-editing-strategy.md).

## Samples

- [`apps/Polhem.Northwind`](../../apps/Polhem.Northwind/README.md) — full Connection → Login → CRUD flow over `FormView`, on four heads (Desktop / Browser / iOS / Android).
- [`samples/Avalonia.DemoCenter`](../../samples/Avalonia.DemoCenter/README.md) — theme-oriented control demo center (theme → case nav, Demo/Source tabs, theme/FormMode toolbar): data binding, read-only/required, FormMode, layout, grid, and native-vs-inherited parity.
